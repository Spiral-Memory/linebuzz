## **Overview 📘**

**LineBuzz** brings real-time collaboration directly into Visual Studio Code.
Stay in flow with your team using built-in huddles, team management, and persistent chat context—all without leaving your editor.

## **Features ✨**

* **Native Chat**: Real-time team panel directly inside VS Code.

## **Development** 🛠️

LineBuzz uses **Preact** for its frontend and **Supabase** for backend services (auth, real-time sync), integrating directly with the VS Code API.

### **Installation ⚙️**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Spiral-Memory/LineBuzz.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio Code**:

   ```bash
   cd LineBuzz
   code .
   ```
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### **Configuration 🧰**

Create a `.env` file in the project root, based on `.env.example`, and populate it with your Supabase credentials:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
```
These values connect LineBuzz to your project’s backend for authentication and data sync.
Press **F5** to launch the extension in a new VS Code window (Extension Development Host).

That’s it -> LineBuzz will start running in the new window.
